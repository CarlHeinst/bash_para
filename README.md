# Repository of paralell processing bash scripts #

This Repo has been created for my own personal records.

It features scripts that make use of a variety of linux command line tools to carry out parallel executions of linux commands.

The outputs of these commands are appropriately ammended to facilitate injecting them into further scripts of your choice.
